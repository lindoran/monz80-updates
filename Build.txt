Build Instructions for monz80-updates
=====================================

This Repository contains updated MONZ80 sources that compile under zasm.

Requirements
------------
- **zasm**: You need the Z80 assembler `zasm` to build the source files. 
Download and install it from: https://k1.spdns.de/Develop/Projects/zasm/

Source Listing Folder
---------------------
The `original source listing` folder contains:
- The original Z80 assembly source files for the VZ200 Serial Test ROMs.
- Original work by David Dunfield and is (C) Him.
- See COPY.TXT for detials
- Documentation and comments from the original authors.
- Reference binaries and listings for comparison.

(See `README.md` for more details about the contents and history.)

Building
--------
1. Ensure `zasm` is installed and available in your PATH.
2. Open a terminal in this repository's root directory.
3. Run:
    ```
    make
    ```
    The `Makefile` automates the build process:
    - It assembles all `.asm` files in the modules using `zasm`.
    - Output binaries are placed in the appropriate folders.
    - If you want to clean up build artifacts, run:
      ```
      make clean
      ```

Files of note:
MONZ80-OLD.BIN was built using Dave's ASMZ80.COM. It is included here to ensure byte-for-byte accuracy with the original.

For troubleshooting or more details, refer to the `README.md`.
